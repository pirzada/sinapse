# Neural Networks #

There are many interesting Neural Network guides available freely on the Internet.

One of the bests I've found were the ones by Sacha Barber, hosted on [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com). Because a few broken links prevents the easy navigation through those articles, the list below links the articles in they correct order:

  * Part 1 of 3: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/NeuralNetwork_1.aspx
  * Part 2 of 3: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/recipes/Backprop_ANN.aspx
  * Part 3 of 3: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/GA_ANN_XOR.aspx


Um slideshow introdutório, em português, também está disponível neste [link](http://www.comp.ufscar.br/~cesarsouza/download/NeuralNetworks.pps).



# AForge.NET #

[AForge.NET](http://code.google.com/p/aforge/) is a C# framework created by Andrew Kirillov, designed for developers and researchers in the fields of Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence - image processing, neural networks, genetic algorithms, machine learning, etc.

Some really good articles about this framework can also be found in [CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com).
