This project was created to help creating a system for medical diagnosis in the Federal University of Sao Carlos, Brazil, but serves as an all-purpose neural network tool, helper, or even toy, to start experimenting with.

As an open-source project, everyone's invited to give opinions, suggestions, or just browse the code.


This program uses the fabulous [AForge.NET](http://code.google.com/p/aforge) library created by Andrew Kirillov.



### Update (30/03/08) - Sinapse v0.0.0.3a ###
A new alpha (preview) version is on the go and will be available soon. Experimental Code Generation, experimental Excel integration and database analysis tools are already planned features. Also, please note that networks and databases created during the alpha and beta phases are not garanteed to work with across different version releases.


### Update (03/03/08) - Sinapse v0.0.0.2a ###
A new alpha (preview) version is available. Some things still don't work, but the program is in a much more usable state. Now it can fully load, save, train and test networks, partially generate testing reports, but still can't import/export and compare different networks. Please leave me your comment if you try it out!
